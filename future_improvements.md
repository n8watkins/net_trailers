## ðŸŸ¢ **NICE-TO-HAVE IMPROVEMENTS** (Future Work)

### **1. Component Documentation (Storybook)**

- **Goal**: Implement interactive component documentation
- **Benefits**: Better developer experience, visual component testing
- **Effort**: Medium (2-3 hours)
- **Priority**: Low

**Tasks:**

- Install and configure Storybook
- Create stories for new components (VideoPlayerControls, ContentMetadata, SearchResultItem, SearchSuggestionsDropdown)
- Document component props and usage examples
- Add visual regression testing

### **2. Comprehensive Unit Testing**

- **Goal**: Add focused unit tests for newly created components
- **Benefits**: Improved reliability, easier refactoring
- **Effort**: Medium (3-4 hours)
- **Priority**: Medium

**Tasks:**

- Test VideoPlayerControls component interactions
- Test ContentMetadata data display logic
- Test SearchResultItem click handling
- Test SearchSuggestionsDropdown keyboard navigation
- Mock external dependencies properly

### **3. Performance Monitoring & Optimization**

- **Goal**: Measure and optimize bundle size and render performance
- **Benefits**: Faster load times, better user experience
- **Effort**: High (4-6 hours)
- **Priority**: Low

**Tasks:**

- Bundle analysis with @next/bundle-analyzer
- Implement React.memo for frequently re-rendering components
- Add performance monitoring with Web Vitals
- Optimize image loading and component lazy loading

### **4. Code Review Guidelines**

- **Goal**: Establish component size limits and quality standards
- **Benefits**: Prevent future technical debt
- **Effort**: Low (1 hour)
- **Priority**: High

**Tasks:**

- Document maximum component size recommendations (200-300 lines)
- Create PR template with component review checklist
- Add ESLint rules for complexity and file size
- Establish TypeScript strict mode guidelines

### **5. Bundle Size Optimization with Code Splitting**

- **Goal**: Implement route-based and component-based code splitting
- **Benefits**: Faster initial page loads, better Core Web Vitals
- **Effort**: High (5-8 hours)
- **Priority**: Low

**Tasks:**

- Implement Next.js dynamic imports for large components
- Split vendor bundles by usage patterns
- Implement progressive loading for below-the-fold content
- Optimize third-party library imports
