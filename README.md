## 🔑 Key Technical Implementations

### State Management Architecture

The app uses **17 focused Zustand stores** (migrated from monolithic "god store"):

- **Store Factory Pattern**: `createUserStore.ts` - Shared factory for auth and guest stores
- **Storage Adapters**:
    - `FirebaseStorageAdapter` - Real-time Firestore sync for authenticated users
    - `LocalStorageAdapter` - Browser localStorage for guest users
- **Direct store access**: Components use Zustand hooks (`useAppStore()`, `useSessionStore()`, etc.)
- **No provider wrapper**: Zustand works without root provider components
- **Type-safe selectors**: Optimized performance with granular subscriptions
- **Optimistic updates**: Updates with rollback on failure

### Content Type System

Unified type system for movies and TV shows using discriminated unions:

```typescript
// Base interface with shared properties
interface BaseContent { ... }

// Discriminated unions with media_type
interface Movie extends BaseContent { media_type: 'movie', title, release_date }
interface TVShow extends BaseContent { media_type: 'tv', name, first_air_date }

type Content = Movie | TVShow

// Type guards for runtime checking
isMovie(content): content is Movie
isTVShow(content): content is TVShow

// Utility functions for consistent access
getTitle(content)    // Works for both movies and TV shows
getYear(content)
getContentType(content)
getRating(content)

### Authentication & User Data Isolation

- **Critical**: User ID validation before all state updates prevents data mixing
- **Storage**: Firestore for authenticated users, localStorage for guests
- **Session persistence**: localStorage maintains auth state across refreshes
- **Auto-save**: `useSessionData` validates user ID match before persisting
- **Timeout protection**: Firebase operations include 5-second timeout
- **Race condition prevention**: Stores cleared when switching users

### Firestore Data Structure

```
/users/{userId}
  - Profile data, preferences, settings
  - customRows (sub-collection)
  - interactions (sub-collection, 90-day TTL)
  - notifications (sub-collection, 30-day auto-dismiss)
  - watchHistory (sub-collection)
  - childSafetyPIN (sub-document)

/rankings/{rankingId}
  - Public and private rankings
  - Indexed by userId, createdAt, likes, views

/rankingComments/{commentId}
  - Comments on rankings
  - Indexed by rankingId, createdAt

/rankingLikes/{likeId}
  - User likes on rankings

/threads/{threadId}
  - Discussion threads with replies
  - Indexed by category, createdAt, userId
  - Image URLs stored in imageUrl field

/thread_replies/{replyId}
  - Replies to threads
  - Indexed by threadId, createdAt
  - Supports nested discussions

/thread_likes/{likeId}
  - User likes on threads
  - One like per user per thread

/reply_likes/{likeId}
  - User likes on replies
  - One like per user per reply

/polls/{pollId}
  - Polls with voting options
  - Indexed by category, createdAt, userId
  - Support for single/multiple choice

/poll_votes/{voteId}
  - User votes on polls
  - One vote per user per poll
  - Tracks selected options

/sharedCollections/{linkId}
  - Shared collection snapshots
  - Public read access
```

### API Architecture

- **30+ API routes** organized by feature
- **Internal routes** proxy TMDB API calls (API key hidden server-side)
- **TMDB API v3**: Uses query parameter authentication (`?api_key=...`)
- **Error handling** via `utils/errorHandler.ts` with user-friendly messages
- **Rate limiting**: Respects TMDB's 40 requests/second limit
- **Input sanitization**: XSS protection on all Gemini AI routes
- **Caching**: Client-side cache store + server-side caching for improved performance

### AI Integration (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash)

**Smart Search Flow**:

1. User enters natural language query ("movies like Inception with time travel")
2. Query sent to `/api/gemini/analyze` with semantic prompt
3. Gemini extracts:
    - Genres (sci-fi, thriller)
    - Concepts (time travel, mind-bending)
    - Media type (auto-detected: movies)
    - Cast/crew if mentioned
4. Results fetched from TMDB Discover API with extracted parameters
5. Live preview shows result count as user types
6. User can save results as custom collection

**Other AI Features**:

- Collection name generation
- Row name suggestions
- Style-based recommendations
- Surprise query generation

### Auto-Updating Collections

**Cron Job Flow** (Daily at 2 AM UTC):

```
1. Vercel cron triggers /api/cron/update-collections
2. Verify CRON_SECRET for security
3. Query Firestore for collections with autoUpdateEnabled: true
4. For each collection:
   - Fetch TMDB Discover with collection filters
   - Filter to releases after lastCheckedAt
   - Append new content to collection.items
   - Update lastUpdateCount, lastCheckedAt
   - Create notification for user
5. Batch commit to Firestore
```

**Visual Indicators**:

- "Auto" badge on collection cards
- "+5" badge showing new items count
- "Updated 2 hours ago" timestamp

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite using Jest and React Testing Library:

### Test Coverage

- **Components**: UI component tests with user interaction simulation
- **Hooks**: Custom hook tests with mock providers
- **Stores**: Zustand store tests with state management validation
- **API Routes**: API endpoint tests
- **Integration**: End-to-end user flow testing

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
npm run test:ci       # CI mode (used in GitHub Actions)
```

### Test Configuration

- **Environment**: jsdom for browser simulation
- **Setup files**: Automatic React Testing Library configuration
- **Mocking**: TMDB API responses, Firebase services, Gemini AI
- **Coverage thresholds**: Configured in `jest.config.js`

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Sentry Error Monitoring

- **Client-side**: Configured via `sentry.client.config.ts`
- **Server-side**: Configured via `instrumentation.ts` (Next.js 15+ standard)
- **Features**:
    - Automatic error capture and stack traces
    - User session replay
    - Performance monitoring
    - Breadcrumb tracking
    - Privacy protection (PII filtering)
    - Ignores common browser errors

### Google Analytics 4

- **Integration**: Via `@next/third-parties`
- **Events tracked**:
    - Page views
    - User authentication events
    - Content interactions (watchlist add/remove, likes, etc.)
    - Search queries (standard and AI)
    - Ranking engagement
- **Privacy**: Anonymized IP, GDPR compliant

### Vercel Analytics

- **Real user monitoring**: Actual user experience data
- **Integration**: Automatic with Vercel deployment

## 🎨 Toast Notification System

Unified notification system with 6 toast types:

- ✅ **Success** - Green checkmark for successful operations
- ❌ **Error** - Red X mark for error messages (auto-integrated with ErrorHandler)
- ➕ **Watchlist Add** - Blue plus icon
- ➖ **Watchlist Remove** - Orange minus icon
- 👁️‍🗨️ **Content Hidden** - Red eye-slash
- 👁️ **Content Shown** - Green eye

**Usage**:

```typescript
const { showSuccess, showError, showWatchlistAdd } = useToast()
showSuccess('Operation completed', 'Optional description')
```

**Components**: Toast.tsx (5s auto-dismiss), ToastContainer.tsx (positioning), ToastManager.tsx (state bridge), useToast.ts (hook API)

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for modals and heavy components
- **Caching Strategy**:
    - Client-side cache for API responses (10-minute TTL)
    - Firebase Firestore offline persistence
    - Recommendation cache (6-hour refresh)
    - Interaction summary cache (24-hour)
- **Bundle Analysis**: `npm run analyze` to inspect bundle size
- **React 19 Features**: Automatic batching, concurrent rendering
- **Debounced Search**: 300ms debounce prevents excessive API calls
- **Zustand Granular Selectors**: Minimal re-renders

**Performance Metrics**:
