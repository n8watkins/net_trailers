# NetTrailer Project Review

## Summary

This pass focused on verifying the recent `/settings` remediation, the broader session/persistence plumbing, and the high-traffic search experience. The new hydration logic and guest data clearing hold up well under inspection, including the added Jest coverage. The most significant regression risk discovered lies in the search pagination logic: quick-search mode stops after the first page for many result counts. Additional suggestions below target stability, observability, and defensive hardening.

## Suggested Fixes & Enhancements

1. **Quick-Search Loop Guardrails** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    - ✅ Normalize the loop bounds (ceiling, current page cap) - commit 4be175f
    - ✅ Short-circuit when the API returns fewer than 20 items - commit 4be175f
    - ✅ Surface unexpected early exits via debug logger - commit 4be175f

2. **API Resilience** ⏳ **FUTURE ENHANCEMENT**
    - Centralize TMDB fetch + retry (e.g., exponential backoff with timeout) so every API route/component shares the same error handling instead of ad-hoc `fetch` calls.
    - Consider marking TMDB responses as cacheable with `Cache-Control` headers for SSR routes to offload repeat traffic in production.

3. **Search Performance & UX** ⏳ **FUTURE ENHANCEMENT**
    - De-duplicate concurrent quick-search/all-results loads by storing the current fetch promise, similar to the auth store's `loadingPromises`.
    - Track when filtering yields zero matches despite large raw result sets; provide a UI hint suggesting filter relaxation.

4. **Testing Coverage Opportunities** ⏳ **FUTURE ENHANCEMENT**
    - Add integration coverage for `/pages/search.tsx` that ensures URL-driven hydration (e.g., `?q=`) respects child safety filtering.
    - Introduce a Cypress smoke path for guest → auth session switching to confirm `SessionSyncManager`'s optimistic auth flow doesn't flash guest data.

5. **Observability & Logging** ⏳ **FUTURE ENHANCEMENT**
    - Promote existing `authLog/guestLog` utilities to include log levels (info/warn/error) and a mechanism to disable verbose output at build time.
    - Emit structured metrics (count, latency) for TMDB API failures via the call tracker to assist with rate-limit diagnostics.

6. **Edge Cases** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    - ✅ Ensure `useSearch` abort controllers cancel prior requests - commit 4be175f
    - ✅ Hard-limit loops to respect TMDB's 500-page maximum - commit 4be175f

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Patch quick-search pagination logic and add unit coverage for fractional `totalResults` values.
    - ✅ Fixed in commit 4be175f (Math.ceil implementation with hard limits)
    - ✅ Tests added in commit 02c5d26 (6 comprehensive pagination tests)
    - ✅ All tests passing
- [ ] Exercise `/api/search` with mocked TMDB responses to confirm child safety filtering isn't lost when multiple pages are merged.
    - Note: Child safety filtering tested separately in existing test suite
- [x] Run `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, and `npm test` post-fix.
    - ✅ All checks passing (pre-existing type errors unrelated to this fix)
    - ✅ New pagination tests passing (6/6)
    - ✅ Existing test suites unaffected
- [ ] Perform manual QA: search a query returning >20 results, toggle filters, and confirm the "Load more" experience still functions.
    - Recommended for production validation

## Closing Notes

The state-management refactors (guest/auth session isolation, session sync manager) are well structured and now backed by focused tests. Fixing the search pagination edge case and tightening a few resilience screws will bring the search experience to the same reliability standard as the rest of the app.
