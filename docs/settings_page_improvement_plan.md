# /settings Page Audit & Remediation Plan

## Status Summary

- ✅ Issue #1 - COMPLETED (Delete Account Flow)
- ✅ Issue #2 - COMPLETED (Child Safety Mode Bypass)
- ✅ Issue #3 - COMPLETED (Account Management Forms)
- ✅ Issue #4 - COMPLETED (Clear Data + Firestore Fix)
- ✅ Issue #5 - COMPLETED (Debug Logging)
- ✅ Issue #6 - COMPLETED (Preferences Not Exposed) - NEW

## Issue 1 – Delete Account Flow Is Non-Functional (High) ✅ COMPLETED

- **Where**: `pages/settings.tsx:434-444`, `hooks/useUserData.ts:238-270`
- **Impact**: The UI reports success even though `deleteAccount` is a stub, so user data remains intact and users are misled.
- **Resolution Implemented** (commit 784d7cc):
    1. ✅ Implemented real `deleteAccount` in `hooks/useUserData.ts` with Firebase Auth deletion and Firestore cleanup cascade
    2. ✅ Added error handling for `auth/requires-recent-login` case with user-friendly message
    3. ✅ Added `isDeletingAccount` loading state with double-submission prevention
    4. ✅ Added loading UI to ConfirmationModal (spinner, disabled buttons)
    5. ✅ Success flow redirects to home page after 2-second delay
    6. ✅ Guest users are blocked with guard check and error message

## Issue 2 – Child Safety Mode Toggle Bypasses Guest Restrictions (High) ✅ COMPLETED

- **Where**: `pages/settings.tsx:79-103`, `pages/settings.tsx:252-263`
- **Impact**: Keyboard toggles (Space/Enter) skip the pointer guard, letting guests persist restricted settings.
- **Resolution Implemented** (commit eac6221):
    1. ✅ Added keyboard event tracking (onKeyDown for Space/Enter, onKeyUp for cleanup)
    2. ✅ Replaced setTimeout(0) with explicit onPointerUp/onKeyUp cleanup
    3. ✅ Added server-side enforcement in guestStore.updatePreferences() to block childSafetyMode changes
    4. ✅ Cleaned up debug console.log statements

## Issue 3 – Account Management Forms Lack Submission Logic (High) ✅ COMPLETED

- **Where**: Profile (`pages/settings.tsx:906-987`), Email (`pages/settings.tsx:1045-1114`), Password (`pages/settings.tsx:1174-1249`)
- **Impact**: Primary buttons perform no action, leaving core account settings unusable and confusing.
- **Resolution Implemented** (commit 60e35b7):
    1. ✅ Added controlled form state for all three forms (displayName, newEmail, emailPassword, currentPassword, newPassword, confirmPassword)
    2. ✅ Connected forms to Firebase Auth: updateProfile(), updateEmail(), updatePassword()
    3. ✅ Implemented comprehensive validation for each form with user-friendly error messages
    4. ✅ Added loading states (isSavingProfile, isUpdatingEmail, isUpdatingPassword) with spinner UI
    5. ✅ Buttons disabled when invalid or during operations
    6. ✅ Re-authentication implemented for sensitive operations (email/password changes)
    7. ✅ Success/error feedback via toast notifications
    8. ✅ Forms auto-clear on successful update
    9. ✅ useEffect to sync displayName when user changes
    10. ✅ All forms respect OAuth provider (Google users see notices instead of forms)

## Issue 4 – Clear Data Handler Ignores Async Errors (Medium) ✅ COMPLETED (with fix)

- **Where**: `pages/settings.tsx:425-443`, `hooks/useUserData.ts:228-254`
- **Impact**: `clearAccountData` was async but only cleared local Zustand cache, leaving Firestore data intact. Data would sync back on next load, contradicting UI messaging.
- **Resolution Implemented** (commits 0563282 + 6561cdb):
    1. ✅ Made handleClearData async with proper await for clearAccountData()
    2. ✅ Added isClearingData state with double-submission prevention
    3. ✅ Added isLoading prop to ConfirmationModal with spinner and disabled states
    4. ✅ Toast and modal only update after promise settles with proper error handling
    5. ✅ **FIX (6561cdb)**: clearAccountData now calls updateDoc() to clear Firestore arrays before clearing local cache
    6. ✅ **FIX (6561cdb)**: Data no longer reappears after clearing - persistent across sessions

## Issue 5 – Debug Logging Leaks to Production Console (Low) ✅ COMPLETED

- **Where**: `pages/settings.tsx:87-103`, `pages/settings.tsx:527`
- **Impact**: Verbose console logs clutter the browser console and can expose internal reasoning in production builds.
- **Resolution Implemented** (commits eac6221 + current):
    1. ✅ Removed debug console.log from child safety toggle (eac6221)
    2. ✅ Removed console.log from preferences save handler
    3. ✅ Kept console.error statements for production debugging
    4. ✅ User feedback now exclusively through toast system

## Issue 6 – Preferences Not Exposed from useUserData (High) ✅ COMPLETED

- **Where**: `hooks/useUserData.ts:25-135`, `pages/settings.tsx:234-240`
- **Impact**: Settings page expected `childSafetyMode`, `autoMute`, `defaultVolume` from userData but hook didn't expose them. currentPreferences always fell back to hard-coded defaults (false, true, 50), preventing display of actual saved preferences and breaking change detection.
- **Resolution Implemented** (commit 6561cdb):
    1. ✅ Added autoMute, defaultVolume, childSafetyMode to guest branch return
    2. ✅ Added autoMute, defaultVolume, childSafetyMode to authenticated branch return
    3. ✅ Added preference defaults to initializing branch (true, 50, false)
    4. ✅ Settings page now correctly displays actual user preferences
    5. ✅ Change detection works properly - "Save Changes" button only enables when values differ from stored preferences

**Status:** COMPLETE - Preferences now properly exposed and settings page hydrates correctly

## Cross-Cutting Validation

- Re-run `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, and `npm run test:coverage` after implementing the fixes.
- Smoke-test the `/settings` page as both guest and authenticated users to ensure modals, redirects, and toasts behave as expected.
