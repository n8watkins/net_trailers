# Current Development Priorities

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Status: 8.5/10

**Significant progress made on critical issues. Focus now on testing, performance, and production polish.**

---

## ðŸ”¥ **HIGH PRIORITY** (Next 2 Weeks)

**All critical issues have been resolved! The app is production-ready.**

---

## ðŸ”§ **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Next Month)

### 5. Modal Content Pre-loading

**Issue**: Modal grows choppily as content loads
**Priority**: MEDIUM (3-4 hours)

**Technical Solutions:**

- Pre-fetch movie details on card hover (500ms delay)
- Create skeleton component with fixed dimensions
- Ensure consistent modal dimensions during load

### 6. Main Page Caching Strategy

**Issue**: Main page requires loading instead of instant display
**Priority**: MEDIUM (2-4 hours)

**Implementation:**

- Implement React Query/TanStack Query for content caching
- Use `staleTime` and `cacheTime` for trending content
- Add service worker for offline capability
- Consider static generation with ISR for hero content

### 7. Accessibility & PWA Features

**Priority**: MEDIUM (4-6 hours)

- Keyboard navigation audit
- Screen reader compatibility
- PWA implementation (installable, offline capable)
- Web Vitals monitoring setup

---

## ðŸ§¹ **LOW PRIORITY** (Quick Wins)

### 8. Code Quality Cleanup

**Time**: 1-2 hours total

- Fix hardcoded positioning (`top-[50em]`) - breaks responsive design
- Remove dead imports and commented code in typings
- Update personal social profile links (replace generic with Nathan's accounts)

### 9. Firebase Email Templates

**Issue**: Using default Firebase email templates
**Time**: 30-45 minutes

- Customize password reset emails for NetTrailer branding
- Update sender name to "NetTrailer" or "Nathan Atkins"
- Test password reset flow

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Metrics**

### Current State â†’ Target State:

- **Performance**: Good â†’ Excellent (caching + optimization)

### Portfolio Impact:

- **Current**: 8.5/10 (solid foundation, some gaps)
- **Target**: 9.5/10 (production-ready, professional polish)

---

## ðŸš€ **Recommended Implementation Order**

### Week 1: Performance

1. **Main Page Caching** (Days 1-2) - React Query implementation
2. **Modal Pre-loading** (Days 3-5) - Better UX

### Week 3+: Polish

- Accessibility audit and fixes
- PWA implementation
- Code cleanup and final touches

**Total Estimated Effort**: 25-35 hours for complete professional polish
**Minimum Viable Professional**: 15-20 hours (HIGH priority items only)
