# Firebase Authentication Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue

Users are seeing "You're browsing as a guest" even when logged in, indicating the authentication state isn't properly syncing between Firebase and the app's session management.

## What You Need to Check in Firebase Console

### 1. Firebase Console - Authentication

Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/

Check:

- **Authentication** tab ‚Üí **Users**
    - Do you see your logged-in users listed here?
    - Are the user IDs (UIDs) showing up?
    - Check the "Created" and "Last Sign In" timestamps

### 2. Firebase Console - Firestore Database

Check:

- **Firestore Database** ‚Üí **Data**
    - Look for a `users` collection
    - Each user should have a document with their UID as the document ID
    - Inside each user document, look for:
        - `preferences` object
        - `watchlist` array
        - `ratings` array
        - `userLists` object

### 3. Firebase Project Settings

Check:

- **Project Settings** ‚Üí **General**
    - Verify the Project ID matches your `.env.local`
    - Check the Web API Key matches

## Debug Steps in the App

### Step 1: Click the Debug Button

1. Go to the Watchlists page
2. Click the purple "üêõ Debug Auth State" button
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Look for these logs:

```
=== AUTHENTICATION DEBUG ===
1. Firebase User: [should show user object or null]
2. Session Type: [should show 'authenticated' if logged in]
3. Is Guest: [should be false if logged in]
4. Is Authenticated: [should be true if logged in]
5. Active Session ID: [should match Firebase UID]
```

### Step 2: Check Firebase Connection

Look for these logs in console:

```
üî• Firebase Auth Hook Initializing...
üî• Firebase Config: {apiKey: 'Set', authDomain: 'Set', projectId: 'Set'}
üî•üî•üî• Firebase onAuthStateChanged fired!
üî• User: [user object]
```

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: Firebase Config Missing

If you see `Missing` for any Firebase config:

- Check your `.env.local` file has all these:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### Issue 2: Firebase User is null but you're logged in

This means Firebase isn't detecting your authentication:

1. Check browser cookies - Firebase auth uses cookies/localStorage
2. Try logging out and logging back in
3. Check if authentication is enabled in Firebase Console

### Issue 3: Firebase User exists but Session is still 'guest'

This is the current issue - the session manager isn't updating when Firebase detects auth:

- The session reinitialization logic may not be triggering
- Check the console for: `üîÑ Initializing/Switching session...`

## What Data Should Be Where

### In Browser Console (when logged in):

- `user` object should have: `uid`, `email`, `emailVerified`
- `sessionType` should be: `'authenticated'`
- `isGuest` should be: `false`
- `activeSessionId` should match the Firebase `uid`

### In Firebase Console:

1. **Authentication ‚Üí Users**: Your user account should be listed
2. **Firestore ‚Üí users ‚Üí [your-uid]**: Should have your preferences document

### In Browser LocalStorage:

- `nettrailer_guest_id`: Guest session ID (can exist even when logged in)
- Firebase auth tokens (handled automatically by Firebase SDK)

## Quick Test Sequence

1. **Log out completely**
    - Click avatar ‚Üí Sign Out
    - Check console for: `üé≠ User signed out or not authenticated`

2. **Log back in**
    - Use email/password or Google sign-in
    - Check console for: `‚úÖ User is authenticated: [your-email]`
    - Check for: `üîÑ Initializing/Switching session...`

3. **Refresh the page**
    - Session should persist
    - Should NOT see guest message if logged in

## If Nothing Works

The issue might be:

1. **Firebase project mismatch** - Using wrong project credentials
2. **Domain not authorized** - Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Authorized domains
3. **Firestore rules** - Check if read/write is allowed for authenticated users
4. **Browser blocking cookies** - Try incognito mode or different browser

## Next Steps

Based on what you find:

1. If Firebase shows no users ‚Üí Authentication isn't working at Firebase level
2. If Firebase shows users but app shows guest ‚Üí Session management issue (our current problem)
3. If everything looks correct ‚Üí Could be a race condition or timing issue

Let me know what you see in the Firebase Console and browser console logs!
