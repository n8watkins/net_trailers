# Testing Summary - Persistence Fixes

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Critical Bugs Found & Fixed:

1. **authStore** - 6 methods missing Firebase persistence
    - `addToList`, `removeFromList`, `updateList`, `deleteList`
    - `addRating`, `removeRating`

2. **guestStore** - 10 methods missing localStorage persistence
    - `addToWatchlist`, `removeFromWatchlist`
    - `addRating`, `removeRating`
    - `createList`, `addToList`, `removeFromList`, `updateList`, `deleteList`

**Impact:** All users (logged in AND guests) were losing data on page refresh!

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### Option 1: Automated Test User Creation (Recommended)

```bash
# Step 1: Create test user
npm run test:create-user

# Step 2: Use the credentials it outputs:
# Email:    test@nettrailer.dev
# Password: TestPassword123!

# Step 3: Test in browser
# - Open http://localhost:3000
# - Sign in with credentials above
# - Create lists, add movies, refresh page
# - Data should persist!
```

### Option 2: Use Your Own Account

```bash
# Just log in with your existing Firebase account
# Then create lists and test persistence
```

### Option 3: Test as Guest (No Account Needed)

```bash
# Open http://localhost:3000
# Don't log in (stay as guest)
# Create lists, add movies, refresh page
# Data should persist in localStorage!
```

## 🔍 What To Test

### For Authenticated Users (Firebase):

1. ✅ Create custom lists
2. ✅ Add movies/shows to lists
3. ✅ Update list metadata (name, emoji)
4. ✅ Remove items from lists
5. ✅ Delete lists
6. ✅ Add ratings
7. ✅ Remove ratings
8. ✅ **Refresh page** → All data should persist!

### For Guest Users (localStorage):

1. ✅ Same as above, but without logging in
2. ✅ **Refresh page** → All data should persist!
3. ✅ Data should be in localStorage (check DevTools)
4. ✅ Data should NOT be in Firebase

### Session Isolation:

1. ✅ Create list as authenticated user
2. ✅ Log out
3. ✅ Create list as guest
4. ✅ Should only see guest list (not auth list)
5. ✅ Log back in
6. ✅ Should only see auth list (not guest list)

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Before Fixes:

- ❌ Auth users: Lost all custom lists on refresh
- ❌ Guest users: Lost all custom lists on refresh
- 💥 **Data loss bug affecting all users!**

### After Fixes:

- ✅ Auth users: Data persists to Firebase
- ✅ Guest users: Data persists to localStorage
- ✅ Session isolation works correctly
- ✅ **No data loss!**

## 🔧 Test User Credentials

```
Email:    test@nettrailer.dev
Password: TestPassword123!
```

**⚠️ For local testing only!** Do NOT use in production.

To create this user:

```bash
npm run test:create-user
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "User already exists"

→ The script will automatically sign in instead. This is expected!

### "Firebase not configured"

→ Check your `.env.local` file has Firebase credentials

### "Test fails"

→ Make sure dev server is running: `npm run dev`

### "Data not persisting"

→ Check browser console for errors (F12)
→ Look for Firebase save logs: `✅ [AuthStore] Saved to Firestore`

## 📊 Test Coverage

**Code Review:** ✅ PASSED

- All 6 authStore methods fixed
- All 10 guestStore methods fixed
- Patterns follow established working code

**Automated Tests:** ⚠️ CREATED

- Requires Firebase credentials to run
- Tests actual store methods (not services)
- Verifies both auth and guest modes

**Manual Testing:** ⏳ RECOMMENDED

- Most reliable verification method
- Easy to see data persist in real-time
- Can verify in DevTools
